# OpenXData Cirrus

A hosted Google AppEngine application including a graphical form designer and
simple upload/download handling for use with OpenXData mobile form clients. It
was developed to demonstrate how to develop a graphical form designer using
Apache Pivot.

## Why?

The form designer that OpenXData is based on, PurcForms, was notoriously
complicated, hard to use and buggy. To demonstrate how easy it would be to
develop a functional alternative to the development group, I developed this
prototype. It provided editing capabilities that surpassed the original form
designer, without the defects, and a working endpoint to demonstrate that the
designed forms actually worked with deployed mobile clients.

## Requirements

  * A web browser, with the Java plugin enabled
  * (Optional) An OXD mobile client (for mobile upload/download)

## Using

To use the application, direct your Java-enabled browser to:
